        <h2>Youtube Read</h2>
        <p>To fetch summaries, navigate to a Youtube video or playlist, then click the extension icon at the top of your browser.  You should see a yellow bar at the bottom of your webpage with a big 'ole "Fetch Summary" button.  Go ahead and click that and wait for the summaries to be fetched.  This takes time so wait it out for awhile, typically it takes about 10 seconds per video, so if you have a long playlist, go make some coffee and come back.  The summaries will be displayed here shortly.</p>
